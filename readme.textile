h2. Usage

The majority of the tags work the same, with a few exceptions where there are additional parameters available.

They can all be used as either a single tag or a wrapper tag. For example:-

bc. <txp:arc_social_share_twitter />

or,

bc. <txp:arc_social_share_twitter>Tweet This</txp:arc_social_share_twitter>

They're intended to work within an individual article context, so used in an article form. The URL used for sharing will be the default permlink created by Textpattern. However, you can override the URL:-

bc. <txp:arc_social_share_twitter url='http://www.example.com' />

All links created by the tags are URL encoded.

The plugin won't do anything fancy with the way the links work when clicked. So if you want to open the links in a new window you will need to put in place some JavaScript to do this yourself. You can easily add a class to the links to help target them with your JavaScript:-

bc. <txp:arc_social_share_twitter class='bookmarklet' />
